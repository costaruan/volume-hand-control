The created code utilizes the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries in Python, programming language, to recognize a hand. Most specific the thumb finger and the index finger. And these two points define a line that represents the volume level.

There are two bars, one drawn and the other of the computer, with the approximate volume level changing accordingly to the two indicated fingers' movement.
